# BoredomFS

Because I didn't have anything better to do than learn the FUSE API

## Okay so what is it really

BoredomFS is a tool to access a Windows machine from a Linux machine, somewhat like sshfs. The biggest difference is that BoredomFS is primarily a filesystem, not a remote shell; you can run remote programs, but you do that by running the .exe files right from the filesystem.

Additionally, it has a bunch of limitations that don't bother me, and as such, I don't feel like lifting them:

- Plenty of functionality, like setting file owner, permissions or timestamps, remains unimplemented. Some because there's no such thing on Windows, some simply because I'm lazy.
- If you do something wrong, for example try to write to a read-only file or create a directory that already exists, you're likely to get incorrect error codes, like 'No such file or directory'.
- Access is either full or none, there are no usernames or anything. There is only a password, autogenerated by the build system and hardcoded into the binaries. Do not share said binaries, nor the_key.h, with anyone untrusted.
- You can access the Windows-side C:/ drive only.
- Windows server and Linux client only.

## Compilation - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ libfuse-dev
# (not sure if the above is complete)
git clone
make OPT=1
```

## Compilation - other Linux

Adjust the above.

## Compilation - Windows

First, compile for Linux, then copy the_key.h to your Windows build machine.

Second, install MinGW; I use [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/](mingw-w64), others (for example MSYS2) are untested but will probably work. Run `mingw32-make OPT=1`. (Not tested on a real Windows, I just use mingw in Wine. Which also means I don't need to copy the_key.h.)

## Compilation - other

Untested and unlikely to work, but if you're feeling adventurous, feel free to try.

## That's a stupid name

Yes, it is. If you're not satisfied, you may apply for a refund at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>
